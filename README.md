# SC Tracer

**1/14/2016**

This is a ray tracer written in C++ from the scratch. It is an extension of the my final project of _CSCI 580_: 3-D Graphics and Rendering course from University of Southern California. 

The initial commit has the following functions:

* Support of triangle surface
* Direct illumination by ray tracing with area light source
* Reflection and refraction from specular and transparent interfaces
* Indirect illumination by distribute ray tracing and photon map
* Caustic by direct visualization of photon map
* OpenMP multithread for the ray tracing part
